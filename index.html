            <p class = "BoxDescription">Carter O’connor is a smart loner. He tends to avoid people as he doesn't really understand what makes them tick. He is very logical and academically gifted. He Obtained a Phd in Com sci before the age of 25. Carter lives alone in a reasonably sized apartment near the joburg CBD. His only real friend is his next door neighbour. A sweet old granny but he would never admit he likes her and tends to treat her like a childhood enemy. Connor’s moral code is a bit sketchy at best. Since he struggles with understanding people, he lacks a sense of empathy and as long as he comes out of a situation okay or bettered. He does not care who he hurts in the process.
    
                Carter has little to no family. His father died when he was 17, although they were never close. Carter’s only real family is his mom who is a successful doctor and is always busy. This left Carter a bit neglected in childhood leading to a lot of his social problems. Carter’s closest person would be his next door neighbour.
