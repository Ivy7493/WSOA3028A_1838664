            <h1><center><font size = 500 face = "Impact">What is hypertext</font></center></h1>
            <p><center>In the research paper “What is hypertext” the author goes about the task of trying to define what is a hypertext. This was done in response to different fields of academia having different definitions for what hypertext is. The author suggested that the same approach, when used to define words such as “Communism” and ” Natural-selection”, should be used to define what hypertext is. The mathematical definition of hyper being “Multiple dimensions” is found to fit what hypertext is in the context of the worldwide web well. Although when looking at the original coiner of the word. “Link” was never used in describing the hypertext. Only later in the paper “No More Teachers’ Dirty Looks” was the word link used in describing what hypertext was. Here it was mentioned that hypermedia could not exist on paper and would have to exist in the computing world. Here we can see the definition of what hypertext is, is getting closer to what hypertext is considered to be today. The author ends on the note that if we are going to move forward with a singular definition for what hypertext is. Compromises from all academic fields that use the word will be needed. As something as complex as what is hypertext could not be defined in a way that accommodates all fields of academia and what their intended definitions for the word would be.

            <h1><center><font size = 500 face = "Impct"><b>Augmenting human intellect</b></font></center></h1>
            <p><center>The idea’s expressed in “Augmenting human intellect” is astonishingly similar to that of how the world wide web functions and how certain sites like Wikipedia work. The idea of having mechanical punch cards that link through serial holes to information related to that on the card is how sites like Wikipedia can be seen to work. Wikipedia links different pages through hyperlinks which allows the user to continue researching more into a topic or gain a broader understanding of that around and relating to the topic.

                The author also suggested that such a system could not really be employed effectively and suggested that electronic computers might be the best solution as you could off-load the tedious task of organizing and sorting information to them. This path mentioned is what came to be in the present day.
               
                Douglas Engelbart was correct in his assumption, he was also correct in stating that most professionals would be able to use these devices for what he considered a worthwhile price. This prediction could also be seen to be true as nearly every working sector in the world has been transformed by the personal computer. 
               
               Douglas Engelbart’s idea of having sequential non-serial connections between information can be seen to draw parallels to how the internet is structured. Where information is connected in a non-serial way which can also be argued to be a web in structure. Thus Douglas Engelbart can be seen to have theorized how the modern world wide web would function before it was even a conceptual idea.

                The memex machine described in “As we may think” can be seen to draw a lot of parallels to the modem internet and computers. A device that can store and retrieve information for a user is a known function of the modern computer.  The memex machine was described to do a similar function by which the user can bring notes and photos that the memex could replicate by taking a picture of them, indexing them and thus filing them away for future use. This process and function can be seen to mimic the modern computers way of storing data although in a more crude and rudimentary way. The memex machine was also described to have ‘trails’ or connections between relevant information stored in the machine. This idea can be seen to already exist in the modern world through hyperlinks used by websites such as wikipedia. These hyperlinks can redirect users to other pages with more information on the topic being researched thus almost creating a trail of research as talked about in “As we may think”. The projection idea of the memex in which it enlarges a tiny photo to a display in which the user can view it can be seen to be a monitor of sorts. Although it could be argued that the projection idea expressed by the memex is closer to that of an overhead projector. The purpose it serves in the functioning of the machine is that of a modern monitor that a computer would use. Thus the memex device’s design and intended function can be seen to be that of a modern computer. This shows the rate at which the human race has developed. A what seemed like an impossible device 80 years ago is now an integrated part of everyday living in a radical way.

            <h1><center><font size = 500 face = "Impact">A moment in internet history</font></center></h1>
            <p><center>
                In 2013, Edward Snowden, a former CIA employee, revealed to the world the mass surveillance of American citizens by the NSA. This was the first time that many people knew the kind of power the internet had given to organizations such as the NSA and the gross abuse of this power that was going on. The NSA had secretly court order Verizon one of the USA’s largest mobile connection companies to hand over phone records of US citizens. The NSA had also gained access to google and yahoo databases collecting information from millions of account users. This surveillance was done in secret for years before being exposed by Edward Snowden. This incident can be seen to have sparked a conversation still going on to this day about privacy online and collecting user data against their knowledge. For a society that has become more and more web/internet-dependent over the last decade, the conversation of internet privacy is one of great importance. This moment in the internet's history showed the general public just how invasive the internet can be and what it is capable of. After this event saw the rise and popularization of programs known as VPNs(Virtual private networks). These programs are still prevalent today as their add’s are all over social media sites such as youtube. Some notable companies are Nordvpn. These programs offer the service of making it harder for governments and companies to collect users data by hiding where their connection is coming from. In a world where internet privacy is no longer a right but a privilege, companies like these can be seen as the last bastion of defence against an ever-increasing monitor internet.
