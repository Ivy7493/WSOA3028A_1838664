            <h1><center><font color = "#00ff00" size = 500 face = "Impact"><b>Augmenting human intellect</b></font></center></h1>
            <p><center><font color = "#00ff00">The idea’s expressed in “Augmenting human intellect” is astonishingly similar to that of how the world wide web functions and how certain sites like Wikipedia work. The idea of having mechanical punch cards that link through serial holes to information related to that on the card is how sites like Wikipedia can be seen to work. Wikipedia links different pages through hyperlinks which allows the user to continue researching more into a topic or gain a broader understanding of that around and relating to the topic.

                The author also suggested that such a system could not really be employed effectively and suggested that electronic computers might be the best solution as you could off-load the tedious task of organizing and sorting information to them. This path mentioned is what came to be in the present day.
               
                Douglas Engelbart was correct in his assumption, he was also correct in stating that most professionals would be able to use these devices for what he considered a worthwhile price. This prediction could also be seen to be true as nearly every working sector in the world has been transformed by the personal computer. 
               
               Douglas Engelbart’s idea of having sequential non-serial connections between information can be seen to draw parallels to how the internet is structured. Where information is connected in a non-serial way which can also be argued to be a web in structure. Thus Douglas Engelbart can be seen to have theorized how the modern world wide web would function before it was even a conceptual idea.
