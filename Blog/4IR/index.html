    <h1>4th industrial revolution</h1>

    <Article>
        <section>
            <P>The article speaks about the 4th industrial revolution and its place in Africa. It starts by putting forth what the 4th industrial revolution is. The 4th industrial can be described as the use and employment of technology as robot automation, Artificial intelligent etc.

                The article puts forward the idea that South Africa’s and Africa’s economy, in general, is not set up in a way that would support 4IR developments. The economy of South Africa is built on mining, farming and the production of raw crafting goods.  South Africa’s economy relays on cheap unskilled labour to operate these production plants. The 4IR threatens to destroy low-skilled jobs through the process of automation. This could be combated by educating the population with more specialized skills which are favoured in a post 4IR country.

                The problem with education in countries like South Africa is the vast inequality found in society. The people who are impacted by the 4IR change are also the people who cannot afford to reskill themselves through university education. This brings the article’s point of the 4IR being elitist as people who can afford to educate themselves with tertiary education are not necessarily the people that are at risk from the changes the 4IR may bring about.

            </p>

            <p>
                This raises a complex issue with respect to future economic endeavours for the country. As the world economy moves towards the 4IR, as a developing country it would be detrimental to be left behind but at the same time, we cannot move forward with the 4IR without addressing deep-seated inequality that plagues the country. As we move towards a 4IR future...it will surely increase the economic divide in the country. So if steps are taken to give economic empowerment to the people who need it during these years of transition. Africa does not have to be left behind in the 4IR
