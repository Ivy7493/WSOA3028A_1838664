    <h1>Web-based game design</h1>

            Browser games have always been a somewhat popular genre of games due to their accessibility. When I was a kid growing up there were games that most kids who had to privilege of internet connection and a computer or laptop had played at least once. Games like club penguin or Moshi monsters come to mind. All these games were built for web-based consumption. As a game design student who now has some understanding of how web pages and their underlying structure work. It would be a cool exercise to explore this field and see what options there are for web gamed game development.

            Firstly after doing some research, There are some game engines that will produce web-based game products. PlayCanvias is one of them, The underlying source code to the engine is open source and on GitHub but the actual editor that comes built on top of the engine is not, This will have to be accessed through the PlayCanvias website. This would obviously make the experience of web-based development a lot easier but at the same time. One has to question how reliable being forced to work on a web-based engine on a singular site would be. Considering that if your internet goes now, there would be no realistic way to work on your game.

            These engines have an export html5 option but with further research, this exported html5 is not human-readable but more a pseudo machine code rendition of html5. On the market, at the moment there are 3 full 3d rendering javascript native engines, PlayCanvias and BabylonJS. So what I could see from there development is that javascript is used as the base language for logic which is then extrapolated onto objects that are drawn into the browser on a Canvas object I believe is found in HTML5. These can be seen to operate like their native windows/Linux and mac os counterparts. These engines are put in place to make, making these type of games more accessible to the wider audience. My current HTML knowledge is not extensive enough in order to really get into how these engines work but knowing that javascript as a language itself has the power to create a web-based game engine, can really show one the wide range of flexibility that a language like Javascript has in its applications
