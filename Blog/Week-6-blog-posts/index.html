        <h1>Metaphor design for user interface</h1>
        <p>This paper focuses on the usage of metaphors when designing user interfaces to improve the user experience and allow new users to learn the system faster. An example of this would be the recycling bin in windows. When a user deletes a program or file, the file is sent to the recycling bin. This metaphor is akin to an office worker throwing old paper or files into the recycling bin. By using such a metaphor or association in the digital space. It allows users to quickly gain an understanding of the function of the recycling bin through associative context alone. My take on this is by using metaphors and already day to day established conventions to represent program interfaces. One can increase your programs accessibility, not just to the people who are comfortable in the digital space but also those who are new. 
        </p>
        <p>A problem put forth by the paper is that metaphors can often be culturally bound. This can prove difficult in certain situations. As a metaphor that might be culturally obvious to one person may hold next to no relevance for the next. In order to combat this. Interface designers should try to use universal metaphors when designing their interfaces for effective implementation. An example of a universal sign/ metaphor could be that of the traditional male/female bathroom icons. As no matter where you are in the world, even if you are in a place that speaks a different language to yours. These bathroom signs are understood by all and thus people know that there are bathrooms here.

        <p>In 1977 the Voyager golden records[1] were sent into space. These discs were to hold information about the human race that may be an alien species might recover one day. The biggest challenge in designing these discs was how one created or encoded information for a species that could have little to no cultural understanding of human symbols. How does one present information in a way that organisms with no understanding of humans and or earth could decipher the information?  One of the ways they tried to solve this problem was by encoding the first couple of digits of PI into binary. 
        </p>
        <p>Thus the struggle of metaphor in design is not a new issue but one can see the potential impact that cultural bias has in metaphors. I find this field extremely interesting as how can one completely remove cultural bias in order to produce a metaphor that could be understood universally?</center></font></p>
