    <p>The radical AI podcast we were prescribed to listen to talk upon the subject of race and how it interplays with technology. The podcast talks about how systemic biases and racism, not even know the creator, can make its way into their respective creations. The best-illustrated example the podcast gave was that of automation and some of the challenges associated with that field of technology production. Here it was found that automatic soap dispensers would only work on lighter coloured skin tones and would work for those of darker pigment. The point put forth with this example was, how was an issue like this able to slip through production and make it into the commercial release of the product. This would give us an insight into the people involved with its production and an assumption of what their racial backgrounds were.

        This is just one example of how race and technology can be intertwined in unexpected ways and illustrates the potential impact this relationship might have on everyday life. In an article written by the Guardian[1], We can further explore this inherent relationship with the use of facial recognition software in felony convictions. The article talks about how facial recognition software is biased against people of colour and has more chances of resulting in false positives for people of colour over those who are not of colour.  This article links to research done by the FBI on facial recognition software as its evidence for such a claim[2]. It was found that the neural network that was used to train the facial recognition software was mostly trained on white people. This lack of diversity used in training the program resulted in poor performance when used in conjugation with other racial groups.

        Issues of racial diversity when it comes to software development should be one of great importance and needs to be discussed more. As our world heads towards the 4th industrial revolution of the automation revolution. These issues become more and more prevalent in everyday life. Ignoring these issues may lead to additional systemic bias and racism being introduced into our society by machines that have been trained in non-diverse environments. It is therefore imperative that future software engineerings and those working in the field of software development and technology make a concerted effort to be more diverse in the developments of their products and the environments they work in. This would help stop issues like the ones mention from becoming a regularly occurring issue. A good place to start for these future professionals would be that of the ACM Code of ethics[3]
