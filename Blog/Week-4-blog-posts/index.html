                In 2013, Edward Snowden, a former CIA employee, revealed to the world the mass surveillance of American citizens by the NSA. This was the first time that many people knew the kind of power the internet had given to organizations such as the NSA and the gross abuse of this power that was going on. The NSA had secretly court order Verizon one of the USA’s largest mobile connection companies to hand over phone records of US citizens. The NSA had also gained access to google and yahoo databases collecting information from millions of account users. This surveillance was done in secret for years before being exposed by Edward Snowden. This incident can be seen to have sparked a conversation still going on to this day about privacy online and collecting user data against their knowledge. For a society that has become more and more web/internet-dependent over the last decade, the conversation of internet privacy is one of great importance. This moment in the internet's history showed the general public just how invasive the internet can be and what it is capable of. After this event saw the rise and popularization of programs known as VPNs(Virtual private networks). These programs are still prevalent today as their add’s are all over social media sites such as youtube. Some notable companies are Nordvpn. These programs offer the service of making it harder for governments and companies to collect users data by hiding where their connection is coming from. In a world where internet privacy is no longer a right but a privilege, companies like these can be seen as the last bastion of defence against an ever-increasing monitor internet.
