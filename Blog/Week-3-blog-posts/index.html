            <p><center><font color = "#00ff00">Metadata can be described as data about data. According to opendatasoft.com[1] “Metadata summarizes basic information about data, making finding & working with particular instances of data easier.” Websites use metadata to optimise their website for search engines. This is known as search engine optimization (SEO). SEO is important as web developers and page owners would want their websites to be showing up in Google searches as the first result. Metadata helps achieve this. Metadata makes it easier for bots, such as google bot, to understand the content that you are serving on your website and thus makes it easier for them to index your website in their respective search engines. The example given in class on Monday was that of a baking recipe. In metadata, you can specify a type of content you are displaying on your page. By marking your baking recipe with metadata saying it is a recipe. Your page is more likely to show up when people search for baking recipes. Thus metadata can almost be seen as a summary of what your website serves which helps one serve that content to potential users. Having the correct metadata on your site is important for a web page owner as it can be seen to contribute to how noticeable your page is on an ever-increasing medium. Metadata helps one's web page to not be lost to the void that is the internet and google 2nd-page results.

            <h2><center><font color = "#00ff00" size = 500 face = "Impact">What is hypertext</font></center></h2>
            <p><center><font color = "#00ff00">In the research paper “What is hypertext” the author goes about the task of trying to define what is a hypertext. This was done in response to different fields of academia having different definitions for what hypertext is. The author suggested that the same approach, when used to define words such as “Communism” and ” Natural-selection”, should be used to define what hypertext is. The mathematical definition of hyper being “Multiple dimensions” is found to fit what hypertext is in the context of the worldwide web well. Although when looking at the original coiner of the word. “Link” was never used in describing the hypertext. Only later in the paper “No More Teachers’ Dirty Looks” was the word link used in describing what hypertext was. Here it was mentioned that hypermedia could not exist on paper and would have to exist in the computing world. Here we can see the definition of what hypertext is, is getting closer to what hypertext is considered to be today. The author ends on the note that if we are going to move forward with a singular definition for what hypertext is. Compromises from all academic fields that use the word will be needed. As something as complex as what is hypertext could not be defined in a way that accommodates all fields of academia and what their intended definitions for the word would be.
