    <h1>Augmentation of the physical world with the digital in context of Johannesburg</h1>
    <section>
        <p>For the augmentation of the physical world with the digital. I chose to reflect that requirement through the live tracking section of my website. My character lives just outside of Hillbrow in Joburg, close to wits junction and Parklane hospital. I chose this location as it is close to where I stay in a flat when I am up in Joburg studying and Its the area of Joburg I know best.
        </p>
        <p>The augmentation of the physical world comes about how the digital world has made tracking a lot easier and more dangerous in today’s society. Back in the 1960’s the American public was put under mass surveillance by the CIA[1]. This was accomplished by hiring mass amounts of people to listen to ordinary American phone calls. This could be seen to require a lot of man-hours and effort to achieve. With the invention of the internet and smartphones, the required effort and funding needed has been dropped significantly. The barrier to entry is a lot lower than it used to be and thus allows this type of technology and surveillance to be abused by individuals and governments that wouldn’t have been able to conduct such activities in the past eg Facebook.
        </p>
        <p>The way this all ties together is the website can be seen as a “parody” of such technology abuse as a fake government organization follows an individual around Joburg. This is not done physically by having agents follow and surveil the individual but rather this is accomplished through digital tracking of an individual through the physical space of Joburg. This creates the augmentation of the physical world through that of the digital world. This is further highlighted by the sites “Comment On Location” section were depending on Carter’s current location, different comments left about how the location he is in further dictates how he should be surveilled or watched.
        </p>
        <p>The core focus of this website was to show the amount of invasion tech companies and governments have into ordinary peoples lives and how this should not be underestimated. The power the digital world gives these companies and organisations over peoples physical space is incredible and people shouldn’t be complacent with the technology they get in return. Everything has a price even the digital world.
