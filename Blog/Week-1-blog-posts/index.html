                The memex machine described in “As we may think” can be seen to draw a lot of parallels to the modem internet and computers. A device that can store and retrieve information for a user is a known function of the modern computer.  The memex machine was described to do a similar function by which the user can bring notes and photos that the memex could replicate by taking a picture of them, indexing them and thus filing them away for future use. This process and function can be seen to mimic the modern computers way of storing data although in a more crude and rudimentary way. The memex machine was also described to have ‘trails’ or connections between relevant information stored in the machine. This idea can be seen to already exist in the modern world through hyperlinks used by websites such as wikipedia. These hyperlinks can redirect users to other pages with more information on the topic being researched thus almost creating a trail of research as talked about in “As we may think”. The projection idea of the memex in which it enlarges a tiny photo to a display in which the user can view it can be seen to be a monitor of sorts. Although it could be argued that the projection idea expressed by the memex is closer to that of an overhead projector. The purpose it serves in the functioning of the machine is that of a modern monitor that a computer would use. Thus the memex device’s design and intended function can be seen to be that of a modern computer. This shows the rate at which the human race has developed. A what seemed like an impossible device 80 years ago is now an integrated part of everyday living in a radical way.
