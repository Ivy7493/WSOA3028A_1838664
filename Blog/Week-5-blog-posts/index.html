            <p><center><font color = "#00ff00">According to Wikipedia web interactivity can be defined as [1] “Web interactivity refers to interactive features that are embedded on websites that offer an exchange of information either between communication technology and users or between users using technology.” Thus from this definition, one can see that features such as an embedded google map on an internet providers website could be seen as interactivity.  Interactivity could also be seen as the flow of information in a dynamic way. Information is given in response to information. While searching the internet for examples of interactive websites. I found an interactive page by Pierre herme[2]. This website used web interactivity in a really interesting way but telling an interactive story. The story used dragging buttons to continue the story. Even though the action of dragging the button around the screen wasn’t that in-depth by itself. I noticed I found myself engaged with the story more due to this interactivity being provided by the button. Thus interactivity on the world wide web can be seen to be used as keeping a user engaged. Whether through the exchanging of information such as a map or the basic engagement of dragging a button around. In a world where first impressions on the web really matter. Developers can use interactivity to create websites that can keep people engaged and on the page for longer.
