            <h1>Explaining features of the site</h1>
            <p>
                After feedback, I thought it would be of benefit to explain certain ideas and features of the website. Firstly the website is created not from the perspective of the character detailed in the website. The website is created from the perspective of a government surveillance department. Thus everything is written on the character would be in the third person. The bio of the character on the main page is a short description written by the department to quickly catch up new staff members who are viewing this character's profile. Since the fantasy is that this profile is just one of millions the government department is creating and updating on different people.

                In order to flesh out the character more. All character development from the perspective of the character itself will be done in the social media surveillance section. The purpose of this section of the site is to further emphasize the surveillance going on but also the character itself and how he sees the world through a more personal lens

                These social media posts are written in different colours. These colours are there to indicate the threat level of each statement and how much of a danger it possesses to the government and order. The more reddish a statement appears. The more dangerous it is considered to be.

                Leading on from this threat level. There will be a danger/threat level section of the website. Right now it is just a gif but later ideally it would be set up in an automatic calculation that takes in the social media surveillance posts with the danger levels attached. This section is also meant to flesh out the surveillance fantasy a bit more.

                Lastly is the living tracking section of the website. This section is supposed to be a fantasy tracking software showing the roundabouts of the character at all times. Like before this aspect of the site is there to emphasize the surveillance theme and give the site a more creepy vibe.
