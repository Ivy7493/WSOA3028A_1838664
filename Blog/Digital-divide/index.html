<h1>Digital capital and social divide</h1>
<setion>

    <P>

        The readings for this week brought up the issue of digital capital and thus the resulting social divide caused in online spaces. The most recent example of this can be shown through the app TikTok. Reports have come out that tiktok moderators were told to censor “Poor, ugly and disabled”[1] creators.

    <P>
        “Users with an “abnormal body shape (not limited to: dwarf, acromegaly),” who are “chubby … obese or too thin” or who have “ugly facial looks or facial deformities” should be removed, one document says, since “if the character’s appearance is not good, the video will be much less attractive, not worthing [sic] to be recommended to new users.”’
    
    
    </P>

        This example shows that people who came from disadvantaged socio-economic backgrounds were discriminated against as their digital capital was seen as not enough for them to be taken seriously by TikTok. This further emphasises the point made in “Social capital and the three levels of digital divide” that digital capital is a distinct form of capital that is intertwined with other forms of more reality-based capitals such as economic, social, cultural.

    This idea of digital capital can be further explored through social media sites such as Instagram and Twitter. A person’s following on these apps could be equated to their digital capital and this capital enables additional benefits the large it grows. For example, larger creators on these platforms generally have their content shared around the site more giving them access to opportunities such as brand deals and other avenues of revenue. According to an article written by Distractify[2], the popular blogger David Dobrik is estimated to earn around $40k a video. This can further show the intertwined relationship that digital capital and other reality-based aspects such as social status which can play a role in online social divide.

        These online platforms can be harder for certain demographics of people to infiltrate. Groups such as traditionally disadvantaged people may lack access to the tools and services required to acquire this digital capital in the same way people from traditional advantaged homes might be able to. This can be seen to further emphasis the digital divide created by socioeconomic inequality. Not only does socioeconomics play a role in an individuals ability to acquire this digital capital but the cultural background can also play a role. For example, if a person is unable to speak English(which the majority of the online community at 59% according to Wikipedia use as their language of communication online) This drastically limits a person ability to engage in online content and would limit these people to only content generated by their home language. This in its very nature can be seen to cause a digital divide and put non-English speakers at a disadvantage when it comes to acquiring digital capital.

        So as stated above there are a lot of contributing factors that affect one’s ability to acquire digital capital. And this capital can be seen to have worth just like any other capital we see in today’s society Going forward, society needs to look at solutions in order to address the digital divide caused online by socioeconomic factors and cultural factors.
