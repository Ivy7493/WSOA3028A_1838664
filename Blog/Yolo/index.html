    <h1>Yolo ethical issues</h1>
    <section>
        <p>
            The Yolo algorithm stands for You only look once. Its is a real-time objection recognization algorithm for live video. Siraj Raval has an excellent youtube video on how the algorithm works[1]. So the summarised version is that Yolo works by dividing up each frame of the video into a 13x13 grid. Each box is responsible for making 5 connection with other blocks on the grid. These connections are made based on pixel patterns and how likely a collection of pixels are to be an object. These connections are then weighted with a confidence metric. Then depending on a certain confidence threshold, connections are other kept or destroyed. The remain connections are then fed into a neural network which has been trained to recognize certain types of object classes. Then if the connections fed into the neural network match an object the network has been trained to distinguish, then the result is outputted. This algorithm has a very high success rate at being able to distinguish objects correctly.

            The tweet raised the premise of the creator of the YOLO algorithm has stopped working on all computer vision-related research due to ethical concerns. The original tweet by the creator of the YOLO algorithm cited military application and ethical concerns as the reason for his halt in research. These ethical issues surrounding the Yolo algorithm can best be highlight by things like china’s social credit system[2]. China uses similar facial recognition software to track their citizen all over china in order to give people a social credit score. This system was put in order for the Chinese government to better control its population through monitoring peoples movements and what they had to say about certain topics. This raises serious ethical concerns about how technology like this can be used to enforce certain regimes.

            Even though the real-time object recognition software in itself isn’t inherently bad. One has to take a look at what the applications of developing such technology would be and china’s social credit system[3] shows just how easy this type of software can be abused for unethical purposes such as mass population control. The other issue cited by the original tweet was that of military application of such Yolo-based technologies. The problem with finding out information on military applications is that a lot of the work being done with this technology is currently classified and thus it would make it difficult to try and give a non-speculative answer.  Though reasonable speculation could be made that this type of tech would be used in a wide range of military uses from missile targeting systems to self-driving cars.

            One comes back to the old saying “Just because we can, doesn't mean we should”. There is no denying that the technological applications of the Yolo algorithm are incredible but at the same time, people need to stop and ask themselves if this technology is worth the risk of abuse. Just as seen in the china social credit policy discussed above, technology like this can be used to devalue individual privacy and in a world where privacy is already so heavily invaded with different sites tracking user data and social media. One has to beg the question, is Yolo worth it?
