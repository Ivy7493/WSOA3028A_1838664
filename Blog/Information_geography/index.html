            <center><font color = "#00ff00"> - Information is always moving in a sense <br><br> 
                                            - Certain modes of transport can not allow information to change eg printing press <br><br>
                                            - Controlling the flow of information can be dangerous - eg governments and censorship <br><br>
                                            - Nowadays a restaurant excluded from a map may not be a restaurant if nobody finds it <br><br>
                                            - Pre-digital age, information for all intended purposes was geographically bound <br><br>
                                            - Collecting knowledge required large, powerful organizations...power control <br><br>
                                            - These organizations became guilds and universities which meant formal training emerged thus the access to modifying information became constrained too. <br><br>
                                            - The technology of the time would have also limited the movement of the information <br><br>
                                            - In the digital age, the barrier to entry for information, collecting, understanding and processing has been drastically lowered. Due to things like a modern computer. No longer is information location and proximity bound. <br><br>
                                            - First time ever that there is an equalization of access to information and that everyone can contribute to the construction of knowledge <br><br>
                                            - 3B people with access to the internet. The world population is just over 7B. So just under half the world has access to this growing reservoir of information <br><br>
