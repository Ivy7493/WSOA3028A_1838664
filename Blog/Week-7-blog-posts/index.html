            <h1>Covid-19</h1>
    <p>Recently with the university being closed for recess during the coronavirus. It has created a unique situation in which travelling to campus is no longer safe. With the virus just starting to pick up its infection rate. The end is not in sight and we can expect this problem to persist for a while. This creates a unique problem for not only lectures but also students. Not every student has access to the necessary hardware required to make e-learning mandatory. If every student did, being quarantined would not have such a big impact as it does. Going forward, it should be a class responsibility to come up with solutions to not only help their lectures but their fellow less fortunate students. This blog will focus less on technical learning from the course but will rather explore this ethical issue.
    </p>
    <p>Firstly it would not be fair to make less fortunate students go to internet cafes for connection as this puts them at risk to catch covid-19. These students should be allowed the same luxuries of staying safe at home as the rest of the students. This brings up the issue, how do we get them online? Personally, my thoughts would be to approach a data provider such as mtn or Vodacom and try to organize sim cards in those portal modems for the students. Hopefully if one is able to appeal to these companies for support, we might be able to get a discount when buying these sim cards and devices from them. The money for this could be done through donations from students who can afford to help or by an online fundraiser conducted on behalf of the WOSA game design department. Of course, this is not an ideal solution as it puts other students under financial pressure and the game design department. This could be a problem as people will be put under additional pressure due to the virus and donâ€™t being able to go to work. Not every family has the luxury of a job that will pay them through this difficult time.
   </p>
    <p>My final thoughts on this topic are, we are in unprecedented times. No one anywhere knows what is the best way forward. But if we come together as a department and actively look for a way to solve problems put forth by covid-19. We will be able to solve these problems. We have an incredibly dedicated department filled with people who care for others.  We can beat this issue.
